        <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
          <p>Hey folks, the name's Theo, but some people call me Zeus (YES, because I am Greek). I am an energetic, light-hearted and friendly go-getter who wants nothing more in this world than to put smiles on people's faces. I am a 2nd year at the Illinois Institute of Technology majoring in Information Technology and Management. I am currently employed at 2 workplaces. I work as a tech support technician at the Office of Technical Services on campus, and I also am a Personal Trainer at Xsport Fitness. My interests are computers, cars and the automotive industry, fitness, and being successful.</p>
