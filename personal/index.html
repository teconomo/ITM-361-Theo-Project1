      <h2>Bodybuilding</h2>
      <h3>What TRULY is Bodybuilding?</h3>
        <p>Sadly, bodybuilding continues to get a bad rap to its' name. When people think of the term "Bodybuilding", most tend to think of big bulky oiled-up men with biceps bigger than their bodies. Yes, this is true; to a certain extent. Bodybuilding is way more than that. It is a practice that consists of not only hard work, but also immense self-discipline and dedication. It is an art. In essence, <b>Bodybuilding is the process of sculpting one's physique based on proper use of nutritional intake and progressive resistance training</b>. When I say sculpting, yes, it is exactly what you think. It involves looking at yourself in the mirror and figuring out which muscular regions of your body need development and you essentially "sculpt and build" on them.</p>
        <p><b>There are 2 different forms of bodybuilding: Classic &amp; Aesthetic (Physique)</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Classic: Classic is defined by normally bigger, bulkier physiques where the primary goal is primarily <b>Mass</b>.</li>
          <li>Aesthetic (Physique): Aesthetic bodybuilding is a lesser version of the Classic and emphasis is more spread out towards an overall body that is "beautiful and pleasing" to the eye. Core work (abs) are usually <b>A LOT</b> more emphasized in this category compared to normally flat stomachs and thin waists as in Classic style.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here are 2 photos to distinguish between a Classic style bodybuilder and an Aesthetic style.</p>
